### Work Experience

- Research Assistant Professor, University of Arizona, 2020

- Research Specialist, Principle, University of Arizona, 2017-2019
    -	Omics Data Management: Oversaw the storage, preprocessing, and sharing of lab omics data (RNA-Seq, single-nuclear RNA-Seq, metabolomics, lipidomics, metadata) across 20+ datasets from 500+ animal models (mouse, rat, human tissue). Ensured timely data release post-publication.
    - Data Compliance & Governance: Managed and tracked data use agreements and applications, ensuring compliance with UK Biobank, NACC, ADNI, ROSMAP, Synapse, FHS, and other datasets.
    - Bioinformatics Training & Support: Trained junior researchers in bioinformatics pipelines, including statistical analysis and inferences, differential expression, pathway analysis, and network analysis.
    - Collaborative Research: Provided bioinformatics expertise to wet-lab teams, built and maintained multiple data analysis pipelines, and integrated omics data (RNASeq, single cell RNASeq, lipidomics and metabolomics) to support translational research.
    - Biomedical & Clinical Research data Analysis:
        -	Data mining and analyzing from real-world datasets (NACC, ADNI, UK Biobank) for Alzheimerâ€™s disease research, contributing to multiple grants and publications.
        -	Conducted clinical study design, omics and biomedical analyses for clinical trials (Allopregnanolone NCT03748303,
PhytoSERM NCT05664477), supporting the $37M Phase II Allopregnanolone trial (NCT04838301).


- Research Associate, Hong Kong Univerisyt of Science and Technology, 2014-2016
    - Pattern Matching & Sequence Analysis: Developed computational methods to generalize research findings using pattern matching across online resources.
    - Feature Engineering: Generated sequence features based on structural analysis to enhance target identification.
    - Target Search & Optimization: Designed regular expression-based feature matching for target discovery. Optimized a peptide targeting MAGUK proteins, potentially linked to Autism.
    - Automated Literature Mining: Implemented web crawlers and keyword-based searches to extract relevant evidence from scientific literature.
