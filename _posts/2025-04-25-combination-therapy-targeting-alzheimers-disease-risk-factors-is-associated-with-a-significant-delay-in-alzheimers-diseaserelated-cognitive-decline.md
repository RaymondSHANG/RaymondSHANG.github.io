### A Data Scientist's View: The Variability of AD
As a data scientist deeply involved in analyzing the NACC dataset, I observed a striking heterogeneity in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While some patients progressed rapidly to severe AD within just 2 years, others maintained relatively stable cognitive function for over 7-10 years. This profound variability prompted my investigation into the factors that may influence AD progression, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential therapeutic interventions.

      <p>Figure A: Individual trajectories of cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), reveal substantial heterogeneity in progression. Lines represent individual patients, illustrating a spectrum from rapid decline to relative stability over 7+ years, and suggesting a potential therapeutic opportunity to convert rapid progressors to slow progressors.
