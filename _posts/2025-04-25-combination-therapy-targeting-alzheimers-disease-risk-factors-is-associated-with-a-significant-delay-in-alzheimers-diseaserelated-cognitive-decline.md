      <p>Figure A: Individual trajectories of cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), reveal substantial heterogeneity in progression. Lines represent individual patients, illustrating a spectrum from rapid decline to relative stability over 7+ years, and suggesting a potential therapeutic opportunity to convert rapid progressors to slow progressors.
