In this blog, I will show ideas accompany with this paper.

### A Data Scientist's View: The Variability of AD
As a data scientist deeply involved in analyzing the NACC dataset, I observed a striking heterogeneity in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While some patients progressed rapidly to severe AD within just 2 years, others maintained relatively stable cognitive function for over 7-10 years. This profound variability prompted my investigation into the factors that may influence AD progression, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential therapeutic interventions.

      <p>Figure A: Individual trajectories of cognitive status in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), reveal substantial heterogeneity in progression. Lines represent individual patients, illustrating a spectrum from rapid decline to relative stability over 7+ years, and suggesting a potential therapeutic opportunity to convert rapid progressors to slow progressors.

### Co-factors that affect AD risk and progression
#### Lasso identified Beta blockers in the effect of AD treatment
To take a quick look, I labeled all AD patients with at least 2 visits as fast/slow progressors, and then built logistic regression models to evaluate the effect of factors distincguish these two groups. Variables with 20% missing values were dropped.

For logistic regression methods, we built 4 models: full logistic regression model based on all variables; the Lasso regression model, hyperparameters tunings are based on 10-fold cross-validation and 1SE rule; the Ridge regression model, hyperparameters tunings are based on 10-fold cross validation and minimum errors; the elastic net regression model, hyperparameters tunings are based on RMSE.

When the number of variables in a prediction problem is very large, lasso regression tries to avoid overfitting and as a result, some of the coefficients go to zero, thus the corresponding variables are eliminated from the prediction. Figure B showed the variable selected by the Lasso and their coefficients.

      <p>Figure B Variable selected by the Lasso and their coefficients: These parameters could be further divided into 4 categories: 1. Overall status: MMSE, AGE, Live or die; 2. Symptoms: language, psychosis, aphasia; 3. Medical treatments: Referred by professional contact, medications for AD symptoms, beta-adrenergic blocking agent; 4. Others.
